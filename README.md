# Arduino Temperature and Humidity Monitor

## Overview:
This project implements a temperature and humidity monitoring system using an Arduino board, a DHT11 sensor, and an LCD display. It aims to provide a simple yet effective way to measure and display environmental conditions in real-time.

## Features:

- Reads temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor.
- Displays the data on an LCD screen in Fahrenheit.
- Easy to set up and customize.

## Hardware Utilized

- Arduino UNO R3
- 830-point Breadboard
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module
- LCD1602
- Jumper wires
- 9V battery with snap-on connector
